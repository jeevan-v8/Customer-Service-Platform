# Solution Workflow

### **4.1 User Authentication**
1. Users log in via **Google OAuth**.
2. The backend verifies the Google token and generates a session for the user.
3. On successful login, users are redirected to the dashboard.

---

### **4.2 Query Submission and Management**
1. Users can create a new request by selecting a category and adding a comment.
2. The frontend sends the request data to the backend via the `/services` POST API.
3. The backend saves the data in **MongoDB** under the appropriate category.
4. Queries are displayed in their respective categories on the dashboard.
5. In the future, **TensorGo’s AI solutions** can be used to automate categorization based on query content.

---

### **4.3 Intercom Integration**
1. The **Intercom widget** is embedded in the frontend for direct communication with support agents.
2. Each query submitted by the user is also sent to **Intercom** via the backend.
3. Support agents can interact with users directly through **Intercom**.

---

### **4.4 Logout Functionality**
1. Users can securely log out by clicking the **Logout** button, which ends the session and redirects them to the login page.
